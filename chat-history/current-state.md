## Project

Chicago Crime + Divvy Bike-Share data engineering pipeline. A learning project that answers: *Does crime near a Divvy station affect ridership?*

- **Repo:** `~/chicago-data-pipeline/` (WSL, Ubuntu on Windows 10)
- **Git:** initialized on `main`, no commits yet (user commits manually)
- **Phase:** 1 COMPLETE. Phase 2 IN PROGRESS (2.1 GBFS exploration ✅, 2.2 Kafka+Zookeeper ✅, 2.3 Producer ✅, 2.4 Spark Streaming ✅, 2.5 DBT Stream Models NEXT). Phase 3, 4 locked.
- **AI mode:** AI-writes-code (user said "you write it" — explicit mode switch from Socratic)

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| Warehouse | Postgres (local) → BigQuery (cloud) | 1 → 4 |
| Batch | Spark DataFrames | 1 ✅ |
| Streaming | Kafka + Spark Structured Streaming | 2 (in progress) |
| Transformation | DBT | 1+ ✅ |
| Orchestration | Airflow | 1+ ✅ |
| Observability | Grafana | 3 (locked) |
| Cloud | Terraform + Airbyte | 4 (locked) |

## Current Infrastructure

### Docker Compose — 10 services (7 Phase 1 + 2 Phase 2 + 1 build-only)

| Service | Image | Status |
|---|---|---|
| postgres | `postgres:16-alpine` | **healthy** — 3 schemas (raw, staging, mart) |
| spark-master | `apache/spark:3.5.1` + JDBC + Kafka connector | **healthy** — UI on port 8180, has `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` env + checkpoint volume |
| spark-worker | same as master | **running** — UI on port 8081, has `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` env |
| airflow-init | `apache/airflow:3.0.0-python3.11` | **exited (0)** — migrations complete |
| airflow-webserver | same | **healthy** — UI on port 8080 (admin/admin) |
| airflow-scheduler | same | **running** — heartbeat active |
| airflow-dag-processor | same | **running** — parses + serializes DAGs |
| zookeeper | `confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.6.0` | **healthy** — port 2181 (internal) |
| kafka | `confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.6.0` | **healthy** — ports 9092 (internal) + 29092 (host) |
| dbt-build | `python:3.11-slim` + dbt | build-only (never runs, exists for `docker compose build`) |

**Note:** At end of session, postgres + spark-master + spark-worker + zookeeper + kafka are running. `raw.station_status` has 5,640 rows from Phase 2.4 verification. Start all services with `docker compose up -d`.

### URLs
- **Airflow UI:** http://localhost:8080 (admin / admin)
- **Spark Master UI:** http://localhost:8180
- **Spark Worker UI:** http://localhost:8081
- **Postgres:** localhost:5432 (user: chicago, db: chicago_analytics)
- **Kafka (host):** localhost:29092
- **Kafka (Docker network):** kafka:9092

### Key Architecture Decisions (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
- **3 Postgres schemas:** `raw`, `staging`, `mart` (no `intermediate`)
- **Two databases in one Postgres:** `chicago_analytics` (warehouse) + `airflow_metadata` (Airflow internal)
- **Airflow 3.0.0** (upgraded from 2.8.4 — 2.x is EOL since April 2026)
- **SimpleAuthManager** (Airflow 3.0 default auth — users via env vars + passwords.json)
- **LocalExecutor** (parallelism without Redis/RabbitMQ)
- **JDBC driver baked into Spark image** (not `--packages` at runtime)
- **Spark UI on port 8180** (8080 conflicts with Airflow)
- **uv init (project mode)** for host Python — `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`
- **`uv pip install --system`** in Docker containers (not `uv sync`)
- **Socrata resource ID is `ijzp-q8t2`** (NOT `ijzp-q4t2` — the plan had a typo)
- **Confluent Platform 7.6.0** for Kafka (not Bitnami — no longer free; not `latest` — pinned)
- **Zookeeper mode** (not KRaft — more educational, traditional setup)
- **Two Kafka listeners:** `kafka:9092` (Docker network) + `localhost:29092` (host testing)
- **3 partitions for `divvy_station_status`** — station_id as key → same station → same partition
- **Single-broker overrides:** replication factor 1 for all internal topics
- **Explicit topic creation** (not auto-create) for custom partition counts — `KAFKA_NUM_PARTITIONS` env var doesn't work with Confluent images
- **4 Kafka connector JARs baked into Spark image** (spark-sql-kafka, spark-token-provider, kafka-clients, commons-pool2)
- **foreachBatch bridges streaming→JDBC** — JDBC has no native streaming sink; foreachBatch gives each micro-batch as a static DataFrame
- **Checkpoint via named volume** `spark_checkpoints` — persists Kafka offsets across container restarts
- **Stale station filter at 1 hour** — 888/2016 stations (44%) had stale `last_reported`; filtered in Spark, not DBT
- **is_* fields cast int→boolean in Spark** — GBFS returns 0/1 integers, not booleans
- **Kafka metadata columns** (partition, offset, timestamp) stored in `raw.station_status` for traceability

## Phase 1 — COMPLETE (1.1–1.6)

All Phase 1 sub-phases verified end-to-end. Cold start → DAG run → 4 tasks succeed → marts queryable (263,394 fact rows). See `docs/phases/phase-1.*.md` for details.

### Phase 1 Key Files
- `ingestion/download_crime.py` — Socrata API → Parquet (263K rows)
- `spark/jobs/crime_batch.py` — Parquet → clean → Postgres `raw.crime_events`
- `dbt/` — staging + marts (dim_date, dim_community_area, dim_crime_type, fact_crime_events)
- `airflow/dags/crime_batch_dag.py` — 4 tasks: download → clear_dbt_schemas → spark → dbt_build
- `dbt/Dockerfile` — separate dbt image (protobuf conflict with Airflow)

## Phase 2 — IN PROGRESS

### Phase 2.1 — Divvy GBFS Data Source (COMPLETE)
- Explored live GBFS feeds: `station_status.json` (2,016 stations, 12 mandatory + 2 optional fields) + `station_information.json` (static-ish dimension data)
- **4 design-changing findings:**
  1. `station_id` is mixed format (667 UUIDs + 1,349 numeric strings) → must stay as string (plan's `station_id::bigint` will fail)
  2. `is_renting`/`is_returning`/`is_installed` are integers 0/1, NOT booleans → need explicit cast
  3. `num_scooters_available`/`num_scooters_unavailable` are optional → Spark schema must tolerate absence
  4. One dead station had `last_reported: 86400` (Jan 2, 1970) → filter stale stations
- Full schema documented in `docs/knowledge/data-sources.md`
- No code written — exploration only

### Phase 2.2 — Kafka + Zookeeper Docker Services (COMPLETE)
- Added `zookeeper` (`confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.6.0`) + `kafka` (`confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.6.0`) to `docker-compose.yml`
- 3 named volumes: `kafka_data`, `zookeeper_data`, `zookeeper_log`
- `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: kafka:9092` added to spark-master + spark-worker
- Verified: topic creation, message produce/consume round-trip on both listeners
- `docs/knowledge/kafka.md` — comprehensive reference with 8 mermaid diagrams (cluster, topic, partition, offset, producer, consumer, broker, Zookeeper, message flow)

### Phase 2.3 — Kafka Producer (COMPLETE)
- `kafka/producers/divvy_producer.py` — polls GBFS every 60s, publishes each station as JSON to `divvy_station_status` topic
  - Key = `station_id` (same station → same partition → ordered processing)
  - Value = full station status JSON
  - Graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown with message flush
  - `--once` (single poll test), `--interval N` (custom cadence), `--bootstrap` (Kafka address)
- `kafka-python` 3.0.8 added to host venv + `airflow/requirements.txt`
- `./kafka:/opt/airflow/kafka` volume mount added to Airflow (for Phase 2.6)
- Verified: 2,016 messages/poll, 3 partitions (720/661/635 distribution), real Divvy data confirmed, continuous mode + graceful shutdown
- **2 errors hit:**
  1. `NoBrokersAvailable` removed in kafka-python 3.0.x → catch `KafkaError` instead
  2. Auto-created topic had 1 partition → `KAFKA_NUM_PARTITIONS` env var doesn't work with Confluent image → explicit `kafka-topics --create --partitions 3`
- Topic `divvy_station_status` was recreated at start of Phase 2.4 (3 partitions, replication factor 1)

### Phase 2.4 — Spark Structured Streaming (COMPLETE)
- `spark/jobs/divvy_stream.py` — Structured Streaming consumer: `readStream.format("kafka")` → `from_json()` → cast types → filter stale → `foreachBatch` → Postgres `raw.station_status`
  - 4 Kafka connector JARs baked into Spark Dockerfile (spark-sql-kafka, spark-token-provider, kafka-clients, commons-pool2)
  - `spark_checkpoints` named volume for checkpoint persistence (Kafka offsets)
  - 60s trigger matches producer poll interval; `--once` mode for testing
  - Stale station filter: `last_reported > now() - 1 hour` (drops 888/2016 = 44% stale stations)
  - is_* fields cast int→boolean; station_id stays string; optional scooter fields nullable
  - Kafka metadata columns (partition, offset, timestamp) stored for traceability
- `raw.station_status` table created in Postgres (18 columns)
- Verified: `--once` mode → 1,128 rows; continuous mode → 5,640 rows over 5 micro-batches (1,128/batch)
- **2 errors hit:**
  1. Checkpoint mkdir failed — named volume mounted as root, Spark runs as `spark` user → `chown` + Dockerfile fix
  2. AQE warning for streaming — not an error, Spark silently disables AQE for streaming queries


### Phase 2 Remaining Sub-phases

| Sub-phase | Status | What to build |
|---|---|---|
| 2.5 DBT models for stream | **NEXT** | `stg_station_status` (staging view) + `fact_station_reads` (one row per station poll) |
| 2.6 Airflow DAG for stream | Not started | `divvy_stream_dag.py` — starts/monitors producer + streaming job |

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2.5: DBT models for stream** — `stg_station_status` + `fact_station_reads`
   - `stg_station_status`: staging view on `raw.station_status` — light cleaning, renaming, type casting
   - `fact_station_reads`: one row per station poll — analytics-ready fact table
   - Will enable querying "avg bikes available at station X over last hour"
   - Requires: `raw.station_status` table (Phase 2.4 provides this, 5,640 rows currently)
2. **Phase 2.6: Airflow DAG** — `divvy_stream_dag.py` (start/monitor producer + streaming)
3. **Phase 2 gate:** Done when `docker compose up` includes Kafka, producer running, Spark streaming writes to Postgres, DBT builds `fact_station_reads`, can query "avg bikes available at station X over last hour"

## Active Constraints
- **Phase gates:** Phase 1 COMPLETE. Phase 2 in progress (2.1–2.4 done, 2.5 next). Phase 3 locked until Phase 2 works. Do NOT skip ahead.
- **Learning protocol:** Socratic by default. User must say "write the code" to get code. Currently in AI-writes-code mode.
- **Three-doc system:** `changelog.md` (errors), `docs/knowledge/` (reference, one file per topic), `docs/operations-performed.md` (audit trail). Update all three after every change.
- **Phase-completion docs:** After each sub-phase is verified, create `docs/phases/phase-X.Y-<name>.md` from `TEMPLATE.md`. Include one high-level mermaid diagram + pointer to `docs/knowledge/architecture.md` for details.
- **Chat-history system:** Update `chat-history/` when context approaches 75%. Update `current-state.md` at the end of a session.
- **Doc maintainability (AGENTS.md rule 14):** When a `.md` file exceeds ~500 lines or ~20KB, split into a folder with one file per section + `index.md`. Append-only logs stay single but get a TOC with anchor links. (changelog.md and operations-performed.md exceed limits but are append-only logs with TOCs — exempt per rule 14.)
- **Mermaid quoting:** All node labels containing `:`, `/`, `$`, `{`, `}` must be wrapped in double quotes. See `docs/knowledge/mermaid-syntax.md` for rules + scanner script.
- **Stable versions only:** User wants non-experimental, production-hardened versions.
- **Treat user as entry-level DE engineer** for explanations, despite actual experience.

## User Preferences

- Wants to understand the *why* behind every choice, not just the *what*
- Treat as entry-level for explanations
- User does git commits manually
- User runs Docker commands manually
- Devin IDE doesn't watch for external file changes — must close/reopen to see OMP edits
- `.venv/` exists (Python 3.13.13), activate with `source .venv/bin/activate`

## Open Questions / Risks

- **Spark Kafka connector:** RESOLVED — `apache/spark:3.5.1` does NOT include Kafka connector. Added 4 JARs to `spark/Dockerfile` (spark-sql-kafka, spark-token-provider, kafka-clients, commons-pool2).
- **`station_id` must be string:** RESOLVED — StringType throughout Spark + Postgres. Works for both UUID and numeric IDs.
- **`is_renting`/`is_returning`/`is_installed` are integers 0/1:** RESOLVED — `CAST(col AS BOOLEAN)` in Spark. Postgres receives proper boolean.
- **Optional scooter fields:** RESOLVED — nullable in Spark schema. `from_json` returns null for missing fields. 1099/1128 non-null.
- **Dead station filtering:** RESOLVED — filter `last_reported > now() - 1 hour` in Spark. Drops 888/2016 (44%) stale stations.
- **Kafka topic:** RESOLVED — `divvy_station_status` recreated at start of Phase 2.4 (3 partitions, replication factor 1).
- **Airflow 3.0 DockerOperator:** Not used in Phase 1 — BashOperator with `docker exec`/`docker run` was simpler. May revisit in Phase 2.6.
- **Bitnami images no longer free** — resolved for Spark (`apache/spark:3.5.1`) and Kafka (`confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.6.0`).
- **`docker compose down` (without `-v`) preserves data** — named volumes persist. Use `-v` only to wipe everything. Kafka data volume (`kafka_data`) also persists.
- **WSL2 memory limit:** 8GB via `.wslconfig`. 10 Docker services may need more — monitor.
- **apache/spark PATH:** `spark-submit` not on PATH. Always use `/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit`.
- **DBT profiles.yml has hardcoded password:** In `.gitignore`. For Phase 4, use env vars or secrets manager.
- **DBT run location:** Must run from inside `dbt/` directory.
- **kafka-python 3.0.x API change:** `NoBrokersAvailable` removed. Use `KafkaError` (base class) for catch-all.
- **`KAFKA_NUM_PARTITIONS` env var doesn't work** with Confluent images. Create topics explicitly for custom partition counts.
