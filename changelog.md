## 2026-07-08 — Project Setup (Windows → WSL migration)

### Changes
- Migrated project planning files from Windows (`C:\Users\sagar\Documents\chicago-data-pipeline\`) to WSL (`~/chicago-data-pipeline/`)
- Flattened folder structure — moved `AGENTS.md`, `chicago-pipeline-plan.md`, and `docs/` to repo root (was nested inside a `devin/` subfolder)
- Renamed repo root from `chicago-divvy-DE-project` → `chicago-data-pipeline` to match `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`
- Initialized git repo, default branch `main`
- Created `.gitignore`, `README.md` with Mermaid diagrams

### Errors & Fixes

| # | Error | Root Cause | Fix | Lesson |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `TRY_CAST(... AS timestamp)` fails in Postgres | `TRY_CAST` is Snowflake/DuckDB syntax, doesn't exist in Postgres | Created `try_cast` DBT macro that dispatches per-warehouse (`::` on Postgres, `SAFE_CAST` on BigQuery) | Always check which SQL dialect your warehouse supports. Don't assume syntax transfers between databases. |
| 2 | `EXTRACT(date FROM c.occurred_at)` errors in Postgres | `date` is not a valid `EXTRACT` field in Postgres | Replaced with `c.occurred_at::date` | Postgres `EXTRACT` only accepts specific fields (year, month, day, hour, etc.). For date casting, use `::date`. |
| 3 | `try_cast` macro silently falls to else branch | Used `target_var.adapter` which isn't a valid DBT Jinja variable | Changed to `adapter.type() == 'postgres'` / `'bigquery'` | DBT Jinja uses `adapter.type()`, not `target_var.adapter`. Test macros with `dbt run` to verify dispatch works. |
| 4 | Docker Compose network names unpredictable with mixed-case folder name | Compose derives project name from directory name; `chicago-divvy-DE-project` has uppercase `DE` | Set fixed `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=chicago-data-pipeline` in `.env` | Always set `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` explicitly. Don't rely on directory-name derivation, especially with mixed-case paths. |
| 5 | Bash commands failed with "Working directory does not exist" | Tool cwd was set to old folder path after rename | Used `cd ~/chicago-data-pipeline && ...` with absolute paths | After renaming the working directory, always verify cwd exists before running commands. Use absolute paths as a safety net. |

### Lessons Summary
- **SQL portability:** Never assume SQL syntax works across warehouses. Test on your actual target.
- **DBT Jinja:** `adapter.type()` is the correct dispatch method, not `target_var.*`.
- **Docker Compose:** Set `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` explicitly — don't rely on folder name derivation.
- **WSL paths:** Keep the repo on the WSL filesystem (`~/`), not `/mnt/c/`. Cross-filesystem mounts are slow.
- **Tool cwd:** After folder renames, verify your working directory before running commands.
